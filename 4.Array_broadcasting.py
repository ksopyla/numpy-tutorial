# yields the final result of shape (2, 3) which is the matrix x with
# the vector w added to each column. Gives the following matrix:
# [[ 5  6  7]
#  [ 9 10 11]]

# we can then broadcast it directly against x to produce the same
# output.

# x has shape (2, 3). Numpy treats scalars as arrays of shape ();

# following array:
# [[ 2  4  6]
#  [ 8 10 12]]
